Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my digital brain dump â€” a place where I jot down the DevOps, infrastructure, and general software engineering lessons Iâ€™ve picked up (sometimes the hard way). Think of it as a mix between a personal wiki, a lab notebook, and a love letter to future-me when I forget how I did that one weird thing with _systemd_.

### Why This Exists
I kept finding myself Googling solutions to problems Iâ€™d already solved... sometimes more than once. So I started keeping better notes, and this blog is the cleaned-up, shareable version of those notes.

If youâ€™re a fellow engineer, sysadmin, SRE, or just someone who loves diving deep into configs and command lines â€” maybe youâ€™ll find something here that helps you too.
